# RFM_Customer_Segmentation_Project
# 🧮 RFM Customer Segmentation – Business Analyst Project

## 📊 Project Overview

The entire workflow simulates a real-world Business Analyst project — from **data cleaning and analysis in Python**, to **interactive visualization in Power BI**, along with **a professional presentation and report** documenting business findings.
